## Installation

Pick the method that suits your platform:

### macOS / Linux / WSL (recommended)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IISweetHeartII/acos-mux/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap IISweetHeartII/tap
brew install acos-mux
```

### Cargo

```sh
cargo install acos-mux
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IISweetHeartII/acos-mux/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IISweetHeartII/acos-mux.git
cd acos-mux
cargo build --release
# Binary is at target/release/acos-mux
```

Requires Rust 1.85+ when building from source.

## First session

```sh
acos-mux
```

That's it. You're inside a multiplexed terminal session with the One Dark theme, a status bar, and all defaults applied. No config file needed.

---

## The leader key

All acos-mux keybindings start with the **leader key**: **Ctrl+Shift**.

You press and hold Ctrl+Shift, then press the action key. For example, `Leader + D` means hold Ctrl+Shift, then press D.

The leader is remappable in your config file. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## Basic navigation

### Splitting panes

```
Leader + D    Split the current pane horizontally (new pane appears below)
Leader + R    Split the current pane vertically (new pane appears to the right)
```

Move between panes with the arrow keys while holding the leader.

### Tabs

```
Leader + T    Open a new tab
Leader + N    Switch to the next tab
Leader + P    Switch to the previous tab
```

### Floating panes

```
Leader + G    Toggle a floating pane that overlays the tiled layout
```

### Fullscreen

```
Leader + F    Fullscreen the active pane (press again to restore)
```

## Session lifecycle

acos-mux sessions persist in the background via a daemon. The typical workflow:

### 1. Create a named session

```sh
acos-mux new work
```

Or just run `acos-mux` for an unnamed session.

### 2. Work

Split panes, open tabs, run commands -- everything stays in the session.

### 3. Detach

```
Leader + Q
```

The session keeps running in the background. You can close your terminal or disconnect SSH.

### 4. List sessions

```sh
acos-mux ls
```

Shows all active sessions.

### 5. Reattach

```sh
acos-mux attach work
```

Pick up exactly where you left off.

### 6. Kill a session

```sh
acos-mux kill work
```

Terminates the session and all its panes.
